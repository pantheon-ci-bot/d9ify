## Status

![Passing Tests](https://github.com/stovak/d9ify/actions/workflows/php.yml/badge.svg)


## USAGE

```composer install && composer d9ify {PANTHEON_SITE_ID}```


The idea behind this site is that there's a single command to create a new Pantheon D9 site from
a messy old D8 site that may or may not be using composer to manage it's dependencies.
